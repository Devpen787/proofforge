# LP-0018 Acceptance Matrix

This file maps the published LP-0018 outcome criteria to implementation missions and evidence. It is not a substitute for the canonical prize specification.

Status vocabulary:

- `unaddressed`
- `in_progress`
- `implemented`
- `locally_verified`
- `testnet_verified`
- `externally_verified`
- `adoption_confirmed`
- `blocked`

## Eligibility gate

Current λPrize policy excludes Logos service providers and their contractors/subcontractors ("Logos CCs") from participation and from counting toward adoption criteria.

Maintainer self-attestation recorded for this project: **not a Logos CC**. This is a project-control record, not legal advice; re-check eligibility before submission if circumstances change.
